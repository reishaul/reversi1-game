/**
 * Implementation and logic by- Re'i Shaul E-mail: reishaul1@gmail.com
 * This class implements the core functionality and rules of the game. It manages the game board, players, turns,
 * and game-specific operations such as placing discs, validating moves, flipping discs, and handling special disc types
 * like bombs and unflippable discs. It also provides methods to check the game's state, undo moves, and reset the game.
 * As we see it, this is the main class for the game, and also the most important.
